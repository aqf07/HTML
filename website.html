      So, you want to make your own website, huh? This will not be an easy journey, and you WILL most definitely suffer a lot.
      In the end, while you may have created the perfect website, both your eyes and fingers will absolutely remember the excruciating pain you put them under,
      and the trauma of html sizing making absolutely zero sense will stay at the back of your head for quite a while. You have been warned &#128522;.

      When you first start learning and building a website, you will experience five stages of emotions. At least, that is what happened to me, so in a way,
      this whole website is a documentation of my own learning process. However, that would  make my website a blog, which is <b> extremely </b> boring and
      uninteresting. So, I decided to share my experience a different way --- in the form of a tutorial.

      <h2 > Learn HTML </h2>
      <p>
        At first, of course you'll be intrigued at the idea of building your own website, and you'll definitely have a lot of questions about how to do so.
        The first step of creating a website is learning <i>how</i> to make one (obviously). Almost all websites are written in a language called <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language"> HTML </abbr>. HTML is not a way to format and
        decorate your website but a way to organize the base logic of your website.
        There are also countless websites out there that have tutorials on the language. The one I recommend (which, not coincidentally, is also the one I used) is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> W3Schools </a>.
        It has an article dedicated to basically everything in HTML. Even as I'm writing this very paragraph, I'm constantly referring back W3Schools.
        HTML organizes an website with <i>tags</i>, and everything should go in a tag. The way you would write this is &lt;tag&gt; content &lt;/tag&gt;. As a summary, here are the most important tags to know:
        <hr>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th> Tag </th>
            <th> Use </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> !DOCTYPE html </td>
            <td> Declares a file to be an html document, goes at the top of every html file </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> html </td>
            <td> Creates the root element of the webpage, should be the second line </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> body </td>
            <td> Contains all the contents of your html file, everything should go in body (or the head tag) </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> div </td>
            <td> Block level divider </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> p </td>
            <td> Represents a paragraph </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> h1 </td>
            <td> Creates a heading. There are 6 different headings of varying sizes </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> img </td>
            <td> Creates an image given a reference link </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> a </td>
            <td> Creates a link given an address </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <hr>
      Of course, there are a lot, and I mean <b>a lot</b>, of other tags, but with these 6 tags, you can probably create a coherent website at least.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="article" id='2'>
        <h2> Play Around </h2>
        <p>
          Now, after some learning and experimentation, you probably have a rough idea of what most tags mean and how they work. <i>However</i>, your website probably
          looks something like this:
          <hr>
          <iframe src="example.html" width=400px height=390px></iframe>
          <hr>
          And something like that, totally sucks. Where are all the colors, the fonts, the style?
          <b>Style</b> is a tag attribute that adds styles to an element in HTML. With style, you can change colors, fonts, sizes, backgrounds, and way more.
          The syntax of style is <br><br> &lt;tag style="property1: value1 property2: value2..."&gt; content &lt;tag&gt;. <br><br>
          The style options that are most commonly used include
          <ul>
            <li> color </li>
            <li> background-color </li>
            <li> font-family </li>
            <li> font-size </li>
            <li> text-align </li>
            <li> border </li>
            <li> height </li>
            <li> width </li>
          </ul>
          With these style properties, you can make your website 100 times better than the hot garbage it was before! Note that there are also other attributes like
          href (attaches a link to text), src (provides the source of an image), class, id, etc, but <del>I'm getting lazy</del> that's for you to learn on your own.
        </p>

        <h2> Annoying Issues </h2>
        <p>
          Now that you're familiar with everything, it's time to actually start building your website. First, you'd want to construct a clear structure and flow of logic.
          And perhaps, if you're like me, a perfectionist and borderline mentally stable, you'd realize that lining up your text boxes is the next hardest thing to waking up in the morning.
          If you haven't noticed already, the white bar to the left of this article is actually way thicker than the bar on the top, and at this point, I've lost all will to fix that problem ---
          this is something you'll just have to live with. However, there are some ways (currently) you can make this calamity a little more livable, and that is using the style options padding and border.
          <br><br>
          In short, these options allow you to change the gap between the textboxes, but from my experience, it is extremely gimmicky. There are many units you can use to determine the amount of padding
          and the width of your borders. The ones that I am familiar with include:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th> Unit </th>
              <th> Definition </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> vh </td>
              <td> Represents 1% of the viewing port's height </td>
            <tr>
              <td> vw </td>
              <td> Represents 1% of the viewing port's width </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> px </td>
              <td> Represents 1 pixel </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> % </td>
              <td> Represents 1% of the parent element </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          In my opinion, you should never use pixel as the format will definitely mess up for different devices. % is also kind of gimmicky, so try to stick with vh and vw.
          Remember these units if you don't want to end up like the guy who created this: <br><img alt="bad borders" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/51Ner.png">
